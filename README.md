# snake_game
Hello everyone.
The code for the snake game in python in provided here.
It is divided into 4 files.
The main file that is to be run to start the game is main.py.
The file snake.py contains code for the snake that roams around on the screen and increases its size every time it eats food.
The food.py file contains code for the food that appears at random position on the screen. If it is being eaten by the snake then it reappears at new random position on the screen.
The soreboard.py file contains the code for the score. the score shows at the top of the screen and increases by 1 each time the snake eats the food.

If you find any fault or error in the code please feel free to tell it to me.
Also give me some advice to upgrade the game.
